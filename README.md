# Machine Learning Model Selection Pipeline

This repository contains my contributions to a team project on supervised learning model selection,
focusing on **data visualization/EDA** and the **SVM modeling & evaluation pipeline**.

## Project Overview
The project explores a structured workflow for building and selecting machine learning models for a classification task, including:
- Data diagnostics and visualization
- Preprocessing and evaluation design
- Model training, tuning, and performance analysis

## My Contributions
I was responsible for:
- **Data Visualization & EDA**: feature distributions, correlation analysis, class imbalance checks, and diagnostic plots
- **SVM Model Selection Pipeline**: leakage-safe preprocessing, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), and final evaluation

## Notebooks
- `notebooks/data_visualization.ipynb`  
  Exploratory analysis and visualization to understand feature behavior and guide modeling decisions.

- `notebooks/svm_model_selection.ipynb`  
  End-to-end SVM workflow including preprocessing, tuning, and evaluation (Accuracy / Macro-F1 / Confusion Matrix).

## Tech Stack
Python · scikit-learn · NumPy · Pandas · Matplotlib

## Notes
This is a **team-developed project**. This repository highlights the parts I implemented and maintained (EDA/visualization + SVM).
